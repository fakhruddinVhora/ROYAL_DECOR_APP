# ROYAL_DECOR_APP
This is the application build for my family store, where we use the power of digitize gadget to enhance and boost the business capacity of a store.

My brother has a paint store where we made the application to instigate the painters to buy the items from it and register there points in this application. Based on the items purchased,
particular points are been awarded and at the end, the one with the highest points is rewarded.


Talking about the technicalities of this app, it uses the standardized Material library which enhances and unifies the UI which is appealing and easy to use by the user.
The coding language is purely Kotlin and have used Firebase Realtime Database as the backend server which provides seamless data storage and interaction.

This app is enabled to run in offline mode, has crashlytics integrated and has been load tested which 1000s of entries, making it quite robust to handle many entries.

Also, pie charts are been displayed which analyses the data and gives the sales analysis to the owner.
